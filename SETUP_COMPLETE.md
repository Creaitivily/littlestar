- Create admin dashboard for content management
- Set up automated monthly refresh via GitHub Actions
- Integrate with AnyCrawl API for trusted source scraping"

git push origin main
```

### 3. GitHub Secrets Setup
Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

Add these secrets:
- **`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`**: `https://ctiewkuervrxlajpjaaz.supabase.co`
- **`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImN0aWV3a3VlcnZyeGxhanBqYWF6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTU1NTQxNjQsImV4cCI6MjA3MTEzMDE2NH0.av5CL8gcxL79C2zCxMSi4icCTAA6de2Cu81g5M7tzRo`
